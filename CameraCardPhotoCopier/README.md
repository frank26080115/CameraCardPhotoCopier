# CameraCardPhotoCopier

Windows system tray background app that detects and then copies photos from SD cards to external drives

It also runs a FTP server for wireless photo transfers from networked cameras

Everything is written specifically for Sony photography cameras

This project is very kludgy, for now, most of the configuration is done by editing static variables inside Program.cs

The free edition of Visual Studio 2019 (or later) is required to open and build this app. Pre-compiled EXE is under bin/Release but it is best practice not to download random EXEs off of github
